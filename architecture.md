# System Architecture

## Overview

The Global Financial Management System (GFMS) is designed to provide a robust platform for managing financial transactions, user accounts, and compliance with regulatory standards. The architecture is modular, allowing for scalability and maintainability.

## Components

- **Frontend**: A web-based user interface built with modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Vue.js).
- **Backend**: A RESTful API built with FastAPI, handling business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.
- **Database**: A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for storing user data, transactions, and application settings.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Interfaces with third-party payment processors for transaction handling.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Interfaces with blockchain networks for secure and transparent transaction processing.

## Deployment

The system can be deployed on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) or on-premises servers, utilizing containerization (e.g., Docker) for easy management and scaling.
