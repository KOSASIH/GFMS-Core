# Security Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines best practices for securing the Global Financial Management System (GFMS).

## Authentication and Authorization

- Use strong password policies and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict user permissions.

## Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using database encryption).
- Regularly audit access logs to detect unauthorized access.

## API Security

- Use rate limiting to prevent abuse of API endpoints.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## Regular Updates

- Keep all dependencies up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Regularly review and update security policies and practices.

## Incident Response

- Develop an incident response plan to address potential security breaches.
- Conduct regular security training for all team members.
